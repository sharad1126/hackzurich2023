Processing of the files (core1?):
	Unzip everything
	Get the filetyp of the unspecified ones
	create subdirectorys in processed files/
	put all the final form files (txt, csv, html, xml) into the processed directory
	convert all text based files (doxc, pdf, ps1) and add it to processed directory
	convert media (jpg,png) and add it to processed directory
	convert xlsx and db to csv and add to processed directory

Analyzing the data (core2?):
	mark mp3 as review
	mark pem as true (?)
	mark pub as false (?)
	analyse txt first and mark
	analyse csv and mark
	analyse html, xml and mark
	
(Problem with marking: If we make new files, we have to keep the original filename somewhere, so that we can mark it)
